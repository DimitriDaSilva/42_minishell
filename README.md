### Example of exercise from CS course

#### Parsing technique

- https://github.com/Swoorup/mysh

#### Suggested in Discord:

Recommended readings for parsing in minishell:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form (maybe not very useful in the case of minishell but this is the format used to describe how a parser should work)

If you want to go further in language theory:
